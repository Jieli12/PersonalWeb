Welcome! I am a Research Officer in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Sciences](https://www.lse.ac.uk).
I completed my Ph.D. study in Statistics at [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science) in September 2021. My main research interest lies in (1) Change-point Detection and Machine Learning, (2) Nonparametric Inference in High-dimensional Statistics, (3) Neuroscience (MEG/EEG Source Imaging). Currently, I am a research officer in the Department of Statistics working with Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz on the change-point detection.

Before I joined in LSE in October, I worked with Professor Shujun Li as a research assistant at University of Kent for two months.   From 2012 to 2017, I had worked at Dali University as a lecturer in statistics for 5 years.
